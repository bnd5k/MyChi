This rails project framework is based of of Hartl's "Rails Tutorial," specifically the sample_app.  It includes some but not all of the excercises recommended.
Use this webapp to give you a simple cms platform that contains the necessary elements of most websites.  

I assume you already have setup Ruby, Rails, and Github.  

Once you clone this repo to your desired directory, CD into the framework directory and type "rails server."  There, you will be asked to provide a new name for your webapp.
Once press the "Rename" button, all the following instances of the term "Framework" will be changed to the name you provided.  But you will still have to manually change 
the root directory's name from framework. (Can't change the present working directory while inside it.)

	app/helpers/application_helper.rb:4
	rakefile:7
	congig/application.rb:18
	config.ru: 4
	config/database.yml: 15, 31, 42
	config/environments/development.rb:1
	config/environments/test.rb:1
	config/environments/production.rb:1
	config/environment.rb:5
	config/initializers/secret_token.rb:7
	config/initializers/session_store.rb:3 (x2) and 8
	config/routes:1
	spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec.rb:7, 16

Also, be sure to add your logo to assets/images since the current default logo is the Rails icon.  You'll also have to update app/helpers/application_helper.rb and
the corresponding test, located in update spec/controllers/pages_controller_spec with the logo's name and location. 

Happy developing!
